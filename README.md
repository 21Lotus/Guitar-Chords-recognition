# Guitar-Chords-recognition
A ML Project to classify guitar chords using CNN.

## Libraries required:
1. numpy
2. keras
3. librosa
4. tensorflow
5. pandas
6. tkinter
7. pygame

### chord_recognition.ipynb 
It creates the trained model model.json for prediction of guitar chords

### classify.py
It uses the trained model model.json to predict a recorded guitar chord using a simple UI. In the UI, just press reocrd and play a chord. It records for 3 seconds and saves the output wav file recoeded.wav. The classify button shows the predicted chord.
